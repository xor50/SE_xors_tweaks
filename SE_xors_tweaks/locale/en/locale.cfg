[technology-description]
xor-cryo-cooling-ingots=Speed up ingot casting with cryonite slush!
xor-water-cooling-ingots=Speed up ingot casting with water! Also produces steam.

xor-advanced-explosives=Advanced chemical knowledge allows production of explosives from other chemical compounds which can save valuable oil.

xor-mineral-water-filtering=Cleaning Mineral Water is not easy, but possible.

[mod-setting-name]
xor-enable-advanced-explosives=K2: enable advanced Explosives recipe
xor-enable-mineral-water-filtering=K2: enable Mineral Water filtering recipe
xor-enable-chemicals-fuel-value=K2: enable fuel value for Hydrogen and Light Oil
xor-swap-electrolysis-outputs=K2: swap output slots of Electrolysis Plant

[mod-setting-description]
xor-enable-advanced-explosives=Advanced alternate recipe for Explosives.
xor-enable-mineral-water-filtering=Enables filtering Mineral Water to Polluted Water (which means it can be further filtered to clear Water).
xor-enable-chemicals-fuel-value=Fluids with fuel value can be used in generators that take fluids like the K2 Gas Generator or the SE Isothermic Generator.
xor-swap-electrolysis-outputs=...to match inputs of Chemical Plants for some recipes.
xor-enable-coal-landfill=Similar to the other landfill recipes in SE.
