[mod-setting-description]
xor-enable-coal-landfill=Similar to the other landfill recipes in SE.
xor-enable-cryo-cooled-casting-recipes=Faster ingot casting recipes via cryo cooling!
xor-enable-water-cooled-casting-recipes=Faster ingot casting recipes via water cooling!
xor-enable-increased-molten-density=Increases density of molten metal by a factor of 2. \nNote: Denser doesn't mean more ingots from same amount, but means easier transportation in high volumes.
xor-enable-increased-caster-speed=Because SE default is crazy and you need an insane number of casters.
xor-enable-kiln-recipes-in-smelting-furnaces=Kiln recipes are e.g. stone -> stone bricks. This option is basically reverting a SE 0.6 change.
xor-enable-nicer-thermofluid-numbers=...for possibly nicer ratios of Radiators. (e.g. instead of 50 -> 49 it's now 51 -> 50)
xor-enable-no-burning-in-space=Makes the AAI Burner Turbine, the vanilla non-electric boiler and the K2 Gas Power Plant not placeable in space. \nIt doesn't make sense to be able to burn things without oxygen and it also increases the value of the Isothermic Generator because that one is intended for space use.
xor-swap-electrolysis-outputs=...to match inputs of Chemical Plants for some recipes.
xor-enable-robot-cargo-fix=Will get removed from mod if fixed officially.
xor-enable-advanced-explosives=Advanced alternate recipe for Explosives made via Ammonium Nitrate.
xor-enable-mineral-water-recipes=Includes filtering Mineral Water to water and boiling Mineral Water for resources.
xor-enable-chemicals-fuel-value=Fluids with fuel value can be used in generators that take fluids like the K2 Gas Power Station or the SE Fluid Isothermic Generator.
xor-enable-415-steam=415°C is what Steam Turbines in K2 take.
xor-enable-900-steam=It's probably good for something... right?
xor-disable-k2-graphics=Disables the K2 graphics for iron plates, copper plates and sand and uses the vanilla graphics instead. Also updates corresponding recipes.
xor-enable-aai-furnace-module-balancing=Because otherwise the K2 Advanced Furnace isn't enough of an upgrade.
xor-enable-k2-advanced-chem-plant-balancing=Because it was way too strong. \nIt is still very good and still has increased module slots.
xor-enable-uranium-balance=Slightly reduces the cost because it was unreasonable high. (Also accordingly balances the output of the reprocessing recipe.) \n[color=red]Note:[/color] enabled/disabling this option after setting up uranium fuel cell reprocessing means you need to re-set the recipes in the centrifuges!
xor-enable-dirty-water-balance=Makes Holmium and Iridium dirty water filtering slightly less useless via slightly increasing results of the recipes.
