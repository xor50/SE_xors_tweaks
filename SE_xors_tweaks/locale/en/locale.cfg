[technology-description]
xor-cryo-cooling-ingots=Speed up ingot casting with cryonite slush!
xor-water-cooling-ingots=Speed up ingot casting with water! Also produces steam.

xor-advanced-explosives=Advanced chemical knowledge allows production of explosives from other chemical compounds which can save valuable oil.

xor-mineral-water-filtering=Cleaning Mineral Water is not easy, but possible.

[mod-setting-description]
xor-enable-advanced-explosives=Advanced alternate recipe for Explosives made via Ammonium Nitrate.
xor-enable-mineral-water-filtering=Enables filtering Mineral Water to Polluted Water (which means it can be further filtered to clear Water).
xor-enable-chemicals-fuel-value=Fluids with fuel value can be used in generators that take fluids like the K2 Gas Power Station or the SE Fluid Isothermic Generator.
xor-swap-electrolysis-outputs=...to match inputs of Chemical Plants for some recipes.
xor-enable-coal-landfill=Similar to the other landfill recipes in SE.
xor-enable-increased-molten-density=Increases density of molten metal by a factor of 2. \nNote: Denser doesn't mean more ingots from same amount, but means easier transportation in high volumes.
xor-enable-cryo-cooled-casting-recipes=Faster ingot casting recipes via cryo cooling!
xor-enable-water-cooled-casting-recipes=Faster ingot casting recipes via water cooling!
xor-enable-increased-caster-speed=Because SE default is crazy and you need an insane number of casters.
xor-enable-robot-cargo-fix=Will get removed from mod if fixed officially.
xor-enable-aai-furnace-module-balancing=Because otherwise the K2 Advanced Furnace isn't enough of an upgrade.
xor-enable-k2-advanced-chem-plant-balancing=Because it was way too strong. \nIt is still very good and still has increased module slots.
xor-enable-kiln-recipes-in-smelting-furnaces=Kiln recipes are e.g. stone -> stone bricks. This option is basically reverting a SE 0.6 change.
xor-enable-900-steam=It's probably good for something... right?
