Version: 1.2.13
Date: 2022-08-27
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed some weird ordering of SE/K2 ore and processing recipes (only affects inventory/crafting menu and machines). This is a UI/visual change only. WIP: Will fix more of those ordering issue if I come across them.
  Info:
    - WARNING: Updating to this (and later) version(s) means you need to re-set all the water- or cryo-cooling recipes, if you used them before in some machines. I'm sorry! (because those recipes are dynamically generated this is not solvable via migration)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.12
Date: 2022-08-26
  Info:
    - Added AAI Motor Speed Tweak (New AAI Recipes) mod as optional dependency.
    - Some behind the scenes compatibility changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.11
Date: 2022-08-23
  Features:
    - K2 balance: Made Holmium and Iridium dirty water filtering slightly less useless.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.10
Date: 2022-08-23
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Steam not leaving Casting Machine in some cases when using the Water-Cooled Ingot Casting recipe due to wrong level of output fluid box.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.9
Date: 2022-08-21
  Bugfixes:
    - Moved the Mineral Water filtration recipe from fluid category to raw resources. Should fix an issue with that recipe being the only one in fluids category and thus adding a new tab.
    - Renamed that recipe to actually reflect what it does ("Mineral water filtration").
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.8
Date: 2022-08-20
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed oversight in pseudo-compat with SE Smelting Tweaks. Reminder: It's probably NOT a good idea to use both at the same time!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.7
Date: 2022-08-20
  Features:
    - K2 fix: Set stack size of (Used Up) Uranium Fuel Cells to 10 as possibly intented by SE.
  Changes:
    - Removed hard incompatibility with SE Smelting Tweaks mod. That does NOT mean that they work well together! You should probably just use this one. Using both is at your own risk!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.6
Date: 2022-08-18
  Features:
    - Thanks to wretlaw120 now compatible with his SE Smaller Radiator Buffers mod.

Date: 2022-08-08
  Features:
    - Enable 415°C Steam recipe in Electric Boiler. (default: off)
  Changes:
    - Re-ordered the mod's options in the mod settings to make more sense.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.3
Date: 2022-08-05
  Bugfixes:
    - Added missing check for Krastorio 2 that resulted in the mod not loading when K2 was not installed. Sorry about that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 2022-08-04
  Features:
    - Added new option for possibly nicer Thermofluid cooling numbers (e.g. 51 -> 50 instead of 50 -> 49). Might allow for nicer Radiator ratios. (default: off)
  Bugfixes:
    - Added an additional check to prevent the mod from not loading when players with BZ mods had also enabled the optional recipes in the BZ foundry mod. In those cases these special recipes will not get a water-cooled variant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2022-08-02
  Features:
    - The K2 Uranium Fuel Cell cost rebalance now correctly rebalances the cost of the fuel reprocessing as well.

Version: 1.1.4
Date: 2022-08-01
  Features:
    - Make kiln recipes available in higher tier furnaces. (default: off)
  Info:
    - Marked the original mod this mod is roughly based on as incompatible because both do basically the same (but mine has more features and options).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.3

  Bugfixes:
    - Grammar fix in setting description.
