Version: 1.3.1
Date: 2022-09-09
  Features:
    - (K2) option to disable K2 graphics changes of some things like plates, also disables the fix mention below (default: off)
  Bugfixes:
    - (K2) fixed wrong colors for iron and steel in some recipes to now hopefully fit the color scheme from K2 much better
  Info:
    - continuation of the internal code restructuring
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2022-09-08
  Features:
    - new (K2) recipe: Mineral Water boiling
      > allows some unusual resource extraction from Mineral Water
      > equivalent to the filtering option, but the other way round: do it for the resources instead for the water
  Changes:
    - (K2) Mineral Water filtration recipe:
      > 25% faster
      > now requires some Sand as filter substrate
      > more efficient: less water loss
      > fixed it accidentally giving Rare Metals instead of the intended Raw Rare Metals
      > now gives Lithium Chloride instead of Lithium
      > now also gives Sulfur
      > rebalanced the output numbers slightly
    - Updated the Mineral Water feature mod setting to include the new feature.
  Info:
    - started doing some internal code restructuring
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.17
Date: 2022-09-03
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed output for steam from Casting Machine using the water-cooling recipe accidentally being marked as in/out instead.
  Info:
    - New mod: Advanced Centrifuge - added it as optional dependency!
      I decided that it's better as extra mod instead of adding it to this one. It's 100% in the spirit of this mod.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.16
Date: 2022-08-29
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed some nil issues preventing the game from starting up when K2 was not enabled. (The reason was some recipes - that actually produce the same resource - being named differently in K2 vs SE/AAI)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.15
Date: 2022-08-28
  Features:
    - Disable certain burner buildings in space because it doesn't make sense that they work without oxygen. This option prevents placing in space the following buildings: AAI Burner Turbine, vanilla non-electric boiler, K2 Gas Power Plant. This also makes the Isothermic Generator more relevant because this one is intented for space use.
  Bugfixes:
    - Finally fixed some weird ordering of SE/K2 items in the raw resources tab! (affects item selection menues like Requester Chests or Recipe Book mod); This is a UI/visual change only.  WIP: Will fix more of those ordering issues if I come across them.
    - One more nil check to prevent crashes with not explicitly compatible mods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.14
Date: 2022-08-27
  Bugfixes:
    - Hopefully prevent some nil errors with other mods having something not set up correctly >.>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.13
Date: 2022-08-27
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed some weird ordering of SE/K2 ore and processing recipes; affects inventory/crafting menu and machines. This is a UI/visual change only. WIP: Will fix more of those ordering issues if I come across them.
  Info:
    - WARNING: Updating to this (and later) version(s) means you need to re-set all the water- or cryo-cooling recipes, if you used them before in some machines. I'm sorry! (because those recipes are dynamically generated this is not solvable via migration)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.12
Date: 2022-08-26
  Info:
    - Added AAI Motor Speed Tweak (New AAI Recipes) mod as optional dependency.
    - Some behind the scenes compatibility changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.11
Date: 2022-08-23
  Features:
    - K2 balance: Made Holmium and Iridium dirty water filtering slightly less useless.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.10
Date: 2022-08-23
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Steam not leaving Casting Machine in some cases when using the Water-Cooled Ingot Casting recipe due to wrong level of output fluid box.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.9
Date: 2022-08-21
  Bugfixes:
    - Moved the Mineral Water filtration recipe from fluid category to raw resources. Should fix an issue with that recipe being the only one in fluids category and thus adding a new tab.
    - Renamed that recipe to actually reflect what it does ("Mineral water filtration").
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.8
Date: 2022-08-20
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed oversight in pseudo-compat with SE Smelting Tweaks. Reminder: It's probably NOT a good idea to use both at the same time!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.7
Date: 2022-08-20
  Features:
    - K2 fix: Set stack size of (Used Up) Uranium Fuel Cells to 10 as possibly intented by SE.
  Changes:
    - Removed hard incompatibility with SE Smelting Tweaks mod. That does NOT mean that they work well together! You should probably just use this one. Using both is at your own risk!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.6
Date: 2022-08-18
  Features:
    - Thanks to wretlaw120 now compatible with his SE Smaller Radiator Buffers mod.
    - Added SE Smaller Radiator Buffers as optional dependency.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.5
Date: 2022-08-08

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.4
Date: 2022-08-08
  Features:
    - Enable 415°C Steam recipe in Electric Boiler. (default: off)
  Changes:
    - Re-ordered the mod's options in the mod settings to make more sense.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.3
Date: 2022-08-05
  Bugfixes:
    - Added missing check for Krastorio 2 that resulted in the mod not loading when K2 was not installed. Sorry about that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 2022-08-04
  Features:
    - Added new option for possibly nicer Thermofluid cooling numbers (e.g. 51 -> 50 instead of 50 -> 49). Might allow for nicer Radiator ratios. (default: off)
  Bugfixes:
    - Added an additional check to prevent the mod from not loading when players with BZ mods had also enabled the optional recipes in the BZ foundry mod. In those cases these special recipes will not get a water-cooled variant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2022-08-02
  Features:
    - The K2 Uranium Fuel Cell cost rebalance now correctly rebalances the cost of the fuel reprocessing as well.
  Changes:
    - Changed the K2 Uranium Fuel Cell cost rebalance option to default: off
  Info:
    - If you want to enabled/disable the K2 Uranium Fuel Cell cost rebalance in an ongoing game please the read the info about the option in the mod settings!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2022-08-02

    - K2 balance: Uranium Fuel Cell cost rebalance (slight reduction)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.4
Date: 2022-08-01
  Features:
    - Make kiln recipes available in higher tier furnaces. (default: off)
  Info:
    - Marked the original mod this mod is roughly based on as incompatible because both do basically the same (but mine has more features and options).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.3
Date: 2022-07-30
  Bugfixes:
    - Grammar fix in setting description.
  Info:
    - Changed dates in changelog to ISO norm.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Made some of the mod's features toggleable via settings. (WIP)
  Changes:
    - Reduced Hydrogen fuel value very slightly to a more fitting number.
  Bugfixes:
    - Reduced power usage of Advanced Chemical Plant to fit its reduced crafting speed.
  Info:
    - Some internal code changes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2022-07-28
  Features:
    - K2 Hydrogen has now a fuel value and thus can be burned for power.
    - Vanilla Light Oil now has a fuel value and thus can be burned for power.
    - New recipe for Explosives, based on the idea of Ammonium Nitrate.
    - New recipe to convert Mineral Water to Polluted Water while extracting a tiny amount of resources.
  Changes:
    - Reduced crafting speed of K2 Advanced Chemical Plant from 8 to 6 because it was way too strong (it's still good).
    - Swapped outputs of K2 Electrolysis Plant to match inputs of Chemical Plant for certain recipes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
